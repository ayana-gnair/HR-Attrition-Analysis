# HR Attrition Analysis in Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding employee attrition — why employees leave an organization.  
The interactive Power BI dashboard was created as part of my virtual internship with **Meriskill**, using real-world business data to find data-driven insights about employee turnover.

The dashboard helps HR teams explore employee trends, identify key reasons for attrition, and plan better retention strategies.

## 💾 Dataset
The dataset was provided through the Meriskill internship program.  
It included employee details such as age, gender, department, job role, education, salary, experience, and attrition status.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To study patterns of employee attrition using data visualization.  
- To identify which departments or groups have high attrition rates.  
- To find key factors that drive employees to leave.  
- To support HR decision-making through data-driven insights.

## 🧩 Tools & Skills Used
- **Power BI** for dashboard creation  
- **Excel** for data cleaning  
- **DAX** for calculated columns and measures  
- **Data Analysis**, **Storytelling**, and **Visualization Design**

## 💡 Key Insights
- Employees aged **26–35** showed the **highest attrition rate**.  
- The **Sales and Research departments** had higher turnover compared to others.  
- **Job satisfaction** and **work-life balance** were major factors influencing attrition.  
- Employees with **less than 3 years of experience** were more likely to leave.  
- High attrition was linked to **lower salary bands** and **long working hours**.
